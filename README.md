Post-Google-Map
===============

Add multiple addresses to a post or page. Addresses will be plotted on a Google Map in your post/page or in the Post Google Map sidebar widget. 

You have the possibility to display all the addresses from all posts in the same map : just add the parameter "display_all" in the short code, like this:
[google-map display_all="true"]
Each point of the map will have a link to its original post/page.
